# ApertureCraft Vanilla
ApertureCraft Vanilla is a Minecraft Vanilla Mod that implements almost all Elements of the Game Portal 2.
This includes Portals, Light Bridges, Cubes, Lasers and Gels.

The Source-Code consists of Minecraft specific Commands.

To build this Project all Source-Files have to be converted into Python-Scripts using the Project MplGenerator.
These Scripts can then be used as Filters in MCEdit to import the Commandblock-Structure into any Minecraft World.
